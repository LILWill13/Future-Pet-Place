# Future-Pet-Place

## Overview

For this project, four team members collaborated to conceive, design, and build a web application from scratch.  We were tasked with solving a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.  This project included the need for teamwork, especially in learning how to use the git branch workflow and push and pull requests.

What problem would we solve?  Our team chose to help address the problem of pet adoption.  According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals, approximately 6.3 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year (https://www.aspca.org/helping-people-pets/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics).  Our team wants to help each shelter-animal to find a good home, and so we put our heads together as to how to help solve this problem.

We designed Future Pet Place, a pet-finder application that helps users search for and locate available pets for adoption.  Our application retrieves information from PetFinder's API.  The pet-seeker is given the option of dog, cat, or bird.  After the user's selection is made, the relevant information is conveniently displayed directly onto the page.

This application was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript languages.  The JQuery and Materialize libraries were also used for this project.

A second API was used to display area-shelters into the application.


## User Story

```
AS A pet-seeker
I WANT to search for Atlanta-area-pets
SO THAT I can research what area pets are available for adoption.

```

## Learning Objectives

This project helped our team to become employer ready by presenting the team members with opportunities to:

```
* Speak technically about a feature we each implemented in the project

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

* Understand and utilize Kanban boards

* Resolve merge conflicts

* Explain agile software development

* Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

```
